## 🚀 Project Setup

### ⚙️ Setting Up the Project with Git

Follow these steps to set up your project and start coding:

1. 🍴 **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. 📥 **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. *(Don't clone the original repo by mistake!)*  

   ```bash
   git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
   ```

3. 🌿 **Create a new branch** for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <your-first-name-last-name>
   ```

4. 💾 **Commit your changes** regularly as you progress.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

5. 🔄 **Push your changes** to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin <your-first-name-last-name>
   ```

### 📝 Completing the Project

1. Submit a **Pull Request** to merge your branch into `main` on your forked repository.  
   👉 **Note:** Do not merge your own pull request! 😅
2. Await feedback and approval from your instructor. 📩

## 🧩 Project Tasks

### 🌐 Part 1: Request Data from the GitHub API

- 📝 Follow the instructions in the `components/GithubCard.js` file to send a GET request to the GitHub API.  
  Use your GitHub username to start exploring the API data! 🌟

---

### 🛠️ Part 2: Create the Component Function

- 📊 Analyze the data returned by the API to understand its structure.
- 🔧 Use the data to dynamically create the HTML template provided in `components/GithubCard.js`.
- 🖼️ Add your card (based on your GitHub profile) to the DOM.

## ✨ Stretch Goals (Optional)

Feeling ambitious? 🧗‍♂️ Try these for extra practice:

1. 🤝 Retrieve your **followers list** from the API and programmatically create cards for each follower.
2. 🔄 **Automate followers' cards creation:** Programmatically fetch and display follower data.
3. 🔍 **Expandable cards:** Add a button to expand/collapse cards and include more user info.
4. 📈 **GitHub Contribution Graph:** Embed your GitHub contribution graph! [Learn how here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34516592/embed-github-contributions-graph-in-website).

## 📝 Reminder

Only Parts 1 and 2 are required. Stretch goals are optional for additional practice—don’t stress if you can’t complete them! 💪
